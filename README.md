This assignment is composed of the following files:

* Report: Group 4 - Assignment 2.pdf
* Code: Assignment 2 Submission.ipynb
* Price demand data: price_and_demand.csv
* Weather data: weather.csv
* Merged data: merged_data_analysed.csv
* Link to Github repository: repository_link.txt

Our code is structured in the following manner:
1. Import files
2. Cleaning data
3. Data Pre-analysis
4. Machine learning analysis
4.1 Regression models
4.2 Classification models    

Instructions:

1. Open the *Assignment 2 Submission.ipynb* file
2. Ensure both *price_and_demand.csv* and *weather.csv* are in the same folder of the .ipynb* file
3. Run all cells
4. A merged_file.csv file is created for your reference with the data for machine learning analysis

The steps followed for all the parts are described in the *Assignment 2 Submission.ipynb* file. The results obtained in Section 4 are analyzed in our report. During our machine learning analysis, we tested different regression and classification models. The initial testing was performed on the random state 43 for all models. Following this, most models were tested 100 times under different parameters to obtain larger result samples on r2 and accuracy scores and then the mean results were obtained for analysis for higher accuracy of our models' results.
